Create a web application where the user can enter any topic, and the system automatically generates a complete Beginner-Friendly README.md style guide along with a Mermaid visual diagram that renders beautifully inside Markdown (like GitHub README).

The app must generate output strictly in pure Markdown format and follow a fixed structured template.

Core Functionality:

A main input field where user enters any topic (for example: HTML Forms, JavaScript Functions, CSS Flexbox, etc.)

On submit, the app generates:

Beginner-level explanation (as if explaining to a child)

Real-life examples

Basic code example

Practical use case example

Mental model explanation

Text-based diagram

Mermaid diagram block

Practice questions

Common mistakes

Summary

Next learning step

The generated output must be structured exactly like this:

📘 {TOPIC_NAME} — Beginner Friendly Guide
🎯 Goal

2–3 lines explaining what the topic does.

🧠 1. Simple Explanation (Bachhe Jaise Samjho)

Very simple language

Short sentences

No difficult words

🌍 2. Real Life Example

2–3 daily life examples

Clear explanation

💻 3. Code Example (Basic)

One simple beginner-friendly code example

Proper markdown code block

Line-by-line explanation

Expected output explanation

⚙️ 4. Code Example (Practical Use)

Real-world problem

Solution using code

Clear explanation

🧩 5. Mental Model

Use analogy (machine, box, water flow, traffic signal, etc.)

Explain in Input → Process → Output format

📊 6. Visual Thinking

Simple text diagram explaining flow

🔷 7. Mermaid Diagram

Must include a properly formatted Mermaid block like:

graph TD
    A[Input] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[Output]


The Mermaid diagram should represent the topic flow clearly and visually.
